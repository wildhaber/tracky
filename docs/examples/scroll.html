  <h4>Etymology and taxonomy</h4>
  <p>The name frog derives from Old English frogga, abbreviated to frox, forsc, and frosc, probably deriving from
    Proto-Indo-European preu = "to jump".[2] About 88% of amphibian species are classified in the order Anura.[3] These
    include around 4,810 species in 33 families, of which the Leptodactylidae (1,100 spp.), Hylidae (800 spp.) and
    Ranidae (750 spp.) are the richest in species.[3]</p>
  <p>The use of the common names "frog" and "toad" has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective,
    all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered "true toads". The
    use of the term "frog" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth,
    moist skins; the term "toad" generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins.[4][5] There are
    numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and
    prefers a watery habitat[6] whereas the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and
    has a smooth skin.[7]</p>
  <p>The Anura include all modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. The
    characteristics of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, the presence of a urostyle formed of fused
    vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused,
    tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw
    without teeth (with the exception of Gastrotheca guentheri) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial,
    dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in Pipoidea),[8] an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces
    underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the lens of the eye.[9] The anuran larva or
    tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and
    denticles.[9]</p>
  <p>Frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of
    primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and
    Neobatrachia, by far the largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most
    common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies
    Hyloidea and Ranoidea.[10] This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae,
    the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted,
    relationships among families of frogs are still debated.[11]</p>
  <p>Some species of anurans hybridize readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid
    between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus).[12] The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina
    and B. variegata are similar in forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid
    zone where the hybrids are prevalent.</p>

  <h4>Evolution</h4>
  <p>The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A
    molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more
    closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the
    Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from
    the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period
    before the groups split.[14] Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that
    lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more
    credible than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East
    Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea.[15] Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this
    study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of
    lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in
    better agreement with the palaeontological data.[16] A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa
    sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, came to the conclusion that Lissamphibia is monophyletic and
    that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that
    Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between
    Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies
    suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.[17]</p>

  <h4>Morphology and physiology</h4>
  <p>
    Frogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws,
    large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, with no more than 10 free vertebrae and
    fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx).[31] Like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable
    skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their
    skins.[32] The ribs are poorly developed, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs
    can maintain its body functions without them.[32] For the skin to serve as a respiratory organ, it must remain
    moist. This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may
    be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream. This may be one of the causes of
    the worldwide decline in frog populations.[33][34][35][36]
  </p>
  <p>
    Frogs range in size from the recently discovered 7.7-millimetre (0.30 in) Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New
    Guinea[37] to the 300-millimetre (12 in) goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of Cameroon. The skin hangs loosely on the
    body because of the lack of loose connective tissue. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to
    protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a tympanum on each side of their
    heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. True toads completely lack teeth, but
    most frogs have them, specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous
    tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths. No teeth are
    in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it
    in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head.[38] The African bullfrog
    (Pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony
    projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.[3]
